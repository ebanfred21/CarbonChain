# 🌍 CarbonChain: Immutable Emissions Tracking

Welcome to CarbonChain, a Web3 solution built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts! This project addresses the real-world challenge of corporate carbon emissions tracking and compliance reporting. In an era of escalating climate regulations (like the Paris Agreement and EU ETS), companies struggle with accurate, tamper-proof data collection and automated reporting. CarbonChain leverages blockchain's immutability to provide transparent emissions logging, automated compliance checks, and verifiable reports—reducing fraud, streamlining audits, and enabling global stakeholders to trust corporate sustainability claims.

## ✨ Features

📊 Immutable logging of emissions data from multiple sources  
🔍 Automated compliance scoring against international standards  
📑 On-chain generation of verifiable reports for regulators  
🛡️ Auditor verification and dispute resolution mechanisms  
💰 Integration with carbon credit tokenization for offsets  
🌐 Oracle-fed external data for real-time factors (e.g., energy prices)  
🚫 Penalty tracking for non-compliance  
🔒 Role-based access for companies, auditors, and regulators  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Companies**  
- Register your organization via the CompanyRegistry contract.  
- Submit periodic emissions data (e.g., CO2 equivalents) through the EmissionsReporter contract, hashed for privacy.  
- Use the CarbonOffsetter contract to mint or burn credits based on verified offsets.  
- Automatically generate compliance reports via the ReportGenerator contract, which pulls data and computes scores.  

**For Auditors and Regulators**  
- Verify submissions using the AuditorVerifier contract with oracle data from OracleIntegrator.  
- Review compliance via the ComplianceCalculator and flag issues in the DisputeResolver.  
- Access immutable audit trails across all contracts for transparent oversight.  

**Core Workflow**  
1. A company registers and gets a unique ID.  
2. Emissions data is submitted and timestamped immutably.  
3. Oracles provide external validation (e.g., satellite data on emissions).  
4. Compliance is calculated against predefined thresholds (e.g., Kyoto Protocol baselines).  
5. Reports are generated on-chain, exportable as verifiable proofs.  
6. Non-compliance triggers penalties tracked in the Governance contract.  

This setup ensures data can't be altered retroactively, automating what was once manual and error-prone reporting—saving costs and building trust in corporate climate action.

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

CarbonChain is powered by 8 Clarity smart contracts, each handling a modular aspect of the system for scalability and security. Here's a breakdown:

1. **CompanyRegistry.clar**  
   - Manages company onboarding: Register with details like name, industry, and wallet address.  
   - Functions: `register-company`, `get-company-details`, `update-profile`.  
   - Ensures unique IDs and prevents duplicates.

2. **EmissionsReporter.clar**  
   - Handles submission of emissions data: Accepts hashed reports with categories (e.g., Scope 1-3 emissions).  
   - Functions: `submit-report`, `get-report-history`, `validate-submission`.  
   - Timestamps entries immutably for audit trails.

3. **OracleIntegrator.clar**  
   - Integrates external data feeds: Pulls real-time info like energy consumption or market prices via oracles.  
   - Functions: `fetch-oracle-data`, `verify-oracle-source`, `update-feed`.  
   - Ensures data integrity for accurate calculations.

4. **AuditorVerifier.clar**  
   - Facilitates third-party audits: Auditors stake tokens to verify reports and resolve disputes.  
   - Functions: `verify-report`, `challenge-submission`, `resolve-dispute`.  
   - Uses voting mechanisms for consensus.

5. **ComplianceCalculator.clar**  
   - Computes compliance scores: Applies rules from international agreements to submitted data.  
   - Functions: `calculate-score`, `set-compliance-rules`, `get-score`.  
   - Automates checks against baselines (e.g., reduction targets).

6. **ReportGenerator.clar**  
   - Generates on-chain reports: Compiles data into standardized formats for export.  
   - Functions: `generate-report`, `export-pdf-hash`, `verify-report`.  
   - Produces verifiable hashes for off-chain sharing.

7. **CarbonOffsetter.clar**  
   - Manages carbon credits: Mint/burn fungible tokens representing offsets.  
   - Functions: `mint-credits`, `burn-credits`, `transfer-credits`.  
   - Links to verified projects for real-world impact.

8. **Governance.clar**  
   - Oversees system updates: Allows DAO-style voting for rule changes or penalty enforcement.  
   - Functions: `propose-update`, `vote-on-proposal`, `enforce-penalty`.  
   - Tracks non-compliance fines and distributes them (e.g., to green funds).

These contracts interact seamlessly—e.g., EmissionsReporter calls ComplianceCalculator post-submission. Deploy them on Stacks for low-cost, Bitcoin-secured transactions. Start by cloning the repo and using the Clarity dev tools to test!
